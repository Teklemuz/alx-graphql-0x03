# ALX GraphQL 0x02
# Overview
GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, making it an efficient alternative to traditional RESTful APIs. By using GraphQL, you can streamline the process of data fetching and significantly improve performance by eliminating issues like over-fetching and under-fetching of data. This repository introduces you to GraphQL and provides practical examples of how to implement GraphQL queries to retrieve specific data from an API.

## What is GraphQL?
GraphQL, developed by Facebook, is a data query language and runtime that allows you to specify the structure of the response you need, making it a flexible and efficient solution for interacting with APIs.

## Key Features:
Flexible Queries: GraphQL enables clients to request only the specific data they need, avoiding unnecessary data fetching.
Single Endpoint: Unlike REST APIs, where each resource typically has its own endpoint, GraphQL allows clients to access all data from a single endpoint.
Nested Queries: GraphQL allows nested queries, which means related data can be fetched in a single request, improving performance and reducing the number of network calls.
Strong Typing: GraphQL uses a type system to define the schema of the API. This ensures that the structure and data types of the responses are clearly defined, enabling strong validation and error handling.
Files
Query Files: Each .graphql file contains a query that fetches information for a specific character. The query asks for character details using the id parameter.

character-id-1.graphql: GraphQL query for character with ID 1.
character-id-2.graphql: GraphQL query for character with ID 2.
character-id-3.graphql: GraphQL query for character with ID 3.
character-id-4.graphql: GraphQL query for character with ID 4.
Output Files: Each .json file contains the response for the respective character ID, showing the data returned by the GraphQL query.

### How to Use
To retrieve character information, you can use a GraphQL tool like GraphiQL, Apollo Client, or any other GraphQL client to execute the queries.

Steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/Teklemuz/alx-graphql-0x02.git
Navigate to the character directory.
cd alx-graphql-0x00/character
Choose one of the .graphql query files (e.g., character-id-1.graphql) and execute the query.
View the corresponding .json output file (e.g., character-id-1-output.json) to see the details returned from the API.
